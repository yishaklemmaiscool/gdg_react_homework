# Portfolio for gdg students
The idea of this project is to create a platform where students can upload their progress and share what new things they learned.



## Task over view
we were asked to build a simple project of our own idea using the things we learned so far.

## Features implemented
- created a jsx file.
- used the features that jsx offers to build the idea.
- imported photos to the assets folder and also used those photos.
- used css to customize the page.
